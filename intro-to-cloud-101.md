# Introduction to Cloud 101
---------------------------

Cloud computing is basically just delivering technology resources or tools over the internet to users as they need them, and users only have to pay for what they actually use.

Modern computing uses the client-server model. Think about it like this: a customer asks a server for something at a restaurant. The server goes and fulfills the request that the customer (or client) made and returns it back to the customer. This is the same with a browser or desktop application (the client) and a server. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud or EC2 is a type of virtual server.

There are many benefits of cloud computing. It saves you money because you only pay for the data storage and the computing power that you are actually using, you don't have to build and maintain your own massive data centers, and because so many businesses use AWS the prices to use it are only getting cheaper. It also improves efficiency and productivity because you don't have to guess the capacity of what your data center can handle anymore, you can implement new tools and technologies into your business instantly rather than having to build out your own data centers with new stuff, and you can reach a global audience because AWS has regions all over the world to help being services to customers with very little delay.


There are different types of ways to deploy to the cloud based on what your business needs. The different deployment models include Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). The different deployment strategies include Cloud, Hybrid, and On-premises.


IaaS is cloud computing in the most granular form and it gives you the most control over your IT resources. Usually IaaS provides access to data storage space, computers, and networking features. Some common AWS services that are considered IaaS include: Amazon EC2, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Relational Database (Amazon RDS), and Amazon Route 53.

PaaS is where organizations that are using AWS do not need to worry about managing the infrastructure like hardware and operating systems (those things are taken care of for them) but rather they can focus solely on deploying and managing new and existing applications for their business. Example of PaaS is AWS Elastic Beanstalk which allows you to quickly deploy and scale web applications.

SaaS is a completed software product where all you have to do is use that software. You don't need to worry about managing anything; just use the software!


Cloud deployment strategy is where you can migrate your organization's applications into the cloud or you can create new applications in the cloud. You can either get really granular with it and manage the infrastrucutre, or you can build and deploy quickly with services that make it easy to do so. Either way, everything will be in the cloud.

A Hybrid deployment strategy is where a company connects their on-premises infrastructure with specific cloud services that are useful for their business needs. They might do this because of certain regulations that require them to keep records on-premises or just because certain applications might work best on-premises for whatever reason. Luckily they can still integrate services that they need from the cloud to their infrastructure to improve their cost and efficiency.

On-premises deployment is sometimes also called private cloud deployment. This is where everything is kept on premises in an organizations own data center but they can still deploy resources to use for their business by using virtualization and application management technologies.
